--About--
Created for a project as part of an object-oriented programming course
primarily implemented using Pygame and Pygwidgets modules as per project guidelines

--Gameplay--
After launch, the "Splash" scene allows the player to enter a desired screen name to be used throughout the play session.
If a name is not entered before beginning, the name will default to "Player 1".
The computer's name defaults to "Player 2"--not a needed feature but was kept with the intention of allowing a second player to enter a name and have highscores saved sessions.
After beginning, the player will choose evens or odds for the 1st round.
3 Rounds will be played, each involving a random roll of 2 dice.
Whichever player's prediction is correct the most times out of the 3 rounds is the winner.
If the player wins, their win streak is tracked until they lose or the program is exited.
The player has the option now to restart if they desire.
